**Scholarship Program**
"Out of this group of developers, a recent report claims that just under half (42 percent) are self taught. As such, Google has recognized the need to reach out to these self-taught developers in order to foster independent development on Android. Therefore, Google has recently announced an initiative to fund 10,000 Android Developer training scholarships for developers residing in the EU. 9,000 of these scholarships will be specifically targeted towards aspiring developers getting their feet wet in the Android Basics course. The remaining 1,000 scholarships will be aimed at experienced developers who will benefit from the Associate Android Developer Fast Track, the training course required to receive the official Android Developer certification." - [[Source](https://www.xda-developers.com/google-bertelsmann-udacity-offer-10000-android-scholarships-for-eu-developers/)]

**Final Project**

I was a recipient of the Google - Udacity EU Scholarship. My final project for 1st Round was a "Tennis Counter": an app that counts the points in a tennis match. I was awarded the 2nd round scholarship: Android Basics Nanodegree[[Repo](https://github.com/KonstantinosBarmpas/Android-Basics-Udacity-Nanodegree-Projects/settings)]
